You are developing an social media application. Consider following requirements:
- users can post articles and pictures
- each user can be friend with any number of other users
- each user can have a list of followed persons (see their articles and pictures)
- each article or picture can have number of likes
- each article or pictures can have many comments

Propose a data model for such application in MongoDB.

Data should support:
- fast access to 'my friends list'
- display content of persons whom I follow
- display article and picture comments and comments authors name
